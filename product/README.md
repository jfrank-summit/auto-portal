# Staking Product Development

This directory contains all product development artifacts for the Autonomys staking application. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that enables operators and nominators to seamlessly stake on Autonomys domains.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

### Vision

Enable operators and nominators to seamlessly stake on Autonomys domains with a friction-less, transparent experience that matches or exceeds Web2 financial apps.

### Success Metrics

- **Time-to-first-stake**: < 5 minutes from landing to submitted transaction
- **Transaction failure rate**: < 1% (30-day rolling window)
- **User satisfaction (SUS)**: ≥ 80 for operators and nominators at GA
- **Staked supply**: ≥ 30% of circulating tokens within 6 months

## 🎯 Target Users

### Primary Personas

- **Farmer Frank**: Active Autonomys farmers with earned AI3 tokens seeking yield
- **Token Holder Tina**: Exchange purchasers looking for passive income opportunities
- **Operator Oliver**: Domain operators needing simplified registration and nomination UX

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Protocol Constraints

- **Two-step withdrawal**: Withdraw request → Unlock after locking period
- **Share-based rewards**: Operators use share pools rather than direct token rewards
- **Storage fund**: 20% of stake allocated to storage fund (refunded on withdrawal)
- **Epoch-based processing**: State changes processed at epoch boundaries

### UX Principles

- **Trust First**: Clear security indicators and transparent fee breakdowns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential info first, details on demand
- **Efficiency**: Minimize clicks for core actions (stake, withdraw)

### Technical Decisions

- **Desktop-first**: Optimized for desktop browsers (mobile-responsive but not priority)
- **React + TypeScript**: Functional programming with strict type safety
- **Auto SDK**: Direct blockchain integration with Polkadot.js fallback
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for wallet and staking data (TBD)

- **Core Nomination Flow**: Browse operators, stake tokens, view portfolio
- **Withdrawal Process**: Two-step withdraw → unlock with clear status tracking
- **Operator Discovery**: Compare APY, tax rates, and operator details
- **Desktop Experience**: Optimized for desktop web browsers

### Post-MVP Features

- **Operator Registration Flow**: UI for domain operators to register
- **Advanced Analytics**: Historical yield charts and performance metrics
- **Batch Operations**: Multi-operator staking and bulk withdrawals
- **Governance Integration**: Voting with staked tokens
